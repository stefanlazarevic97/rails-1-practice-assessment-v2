# Rails 1 Practice

**Do not share this repo or post any parts of it publicly. App Academy will take
violations very seriously.**

You will have **100 minutes** to complete this evaluation. This evaluation
consists of 4 components:

1. [SQL](./sql/README.md)
2. [Active Record Querying](./active_record_queries/README.md)
3. [Migrations](./migrations/README.md)
4. [Associations](./associations/README.md)

## Scoring and time estimates

| Component                | Maximum Points  | Estimated Time (minutes) |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| SQL                      | 10 (2 per spec) | 20 min                   |
| Active Record Querying   | 10              | 25 min                   |
| Migrations               | 21              | 15 min                   |
| Associations             | 23              | 30 min                   |

The maximum number of points for this entire evaluation is **64**. Your final
score will be calculated as the percentage of points awarded over the maximum
number of points:

The passing score for this evaluation is 51 / 64.

## Submission

- Rename the directory `"#{first_name}_#{last_name}"`.
- **Remove any `tmp` and `vendor`** folders to ensure your file won't be too
  big.
- ZIP it. (Mac users can use OS X's built in zip functionality.)
- Make sure you submit a `.zip`; no boutique formats please :-).

Good luck!
